This game is not a political statement. Think of it as a global satire of political campaign, without a particular target. 

Manage your political campaign. Keep an eye on the pollings, the last candidate is eliminated at the end of each primary month. But don't neglect voters, you'll need them if you reach the election! 

Made with FlashDevelop, with the help of Ableton Live 9 (trial version), sfxr, paint.net and a couple of real wood mannequins (I should totally upload some pictures of those...).
